// This module fixes sourcemap paths for the various Amplify packages. It's
// needed because packages at build time live in different (relative) folder
// locations than the folders where packages are installed from npm. For
// example, /packages/aws-amplify/src/index.ts imports @aws-amplify/ui. At build
// time, the aws-amplify and amplify-ui folders are siblings, but when the
// aws-amplify package is installed from npm, the amplify-ui folder is installed
// at ./node_modules/@aws-amplify/ui, which is a new name and is no longer a
// sibling to ./node_modules/aws-amplify like it was at build time. These
// changes mean that end users can't easily debug into Amplify code, especially
// using IDEs like VSCode.
//
// The code in this file changes paths inside Amplify sourcemaps to work around
// the issues above. The following changes are made:
// 1. sourcemap paths that point to node_modules dependencies (e.g. lodash) are
//    mapped to webpack:///./node_modules/*
// 2. sourcemap paths that point to sibling packages under the @aws-amplify
//    alias (like the UI example above) are mapped (using package names, not
//    folders) to webpack:///./node_modules/@aws-amplify/*
// 3. other paths, e.g. relative paths in the same package, or webpack or node
//    builtins, will be left alone (same behavior as current webpack config).
//
// These path mappings are designed to be compatible with VSCode's default
// source mapping options here:
// https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug#sourcemaps
//
// IMPORTANT: if new packages are added to Amplify, add them to the map below.
