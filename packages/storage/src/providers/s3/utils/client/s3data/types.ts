	 *                             You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and
	 *                             Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the <code>CreateSession</code> request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.

	 *                customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption by

We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your

	 *                             Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the <code>CreateSession</code> request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.
