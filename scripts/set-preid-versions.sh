# This script sets the `@aws-amplify/core` peer dependency version when the library is being published with a 
# `preid` version.
#
# By design, Lerna does not update peer dependencies on packages vended by the monorepo as it would defeat the efficacy
# of having peer dependencies in the first place (which indicate a range of compatible versions). This script enables
# us to effectively test the library by pinning the peer dependency version of `@aws-amplify/core` across the library
# to the version being published. This script will not be executed for production releases, which do not specify a
# `preid`.
#
# @remarks
# This script is to be executed after versions have been set but before publication to NPM, e.g. the NPM `prepare`
# life-cycle script which Lerna will invoke. It will set the peer-dependency in each category's package.json file 
# before it gets packaged up and sent to NPM.
#
# @remarks
# This script requires `jq` which is installed by default on Linux. On OSX use `brew install jq`.
